# Introduction

## What is Bayesian Linear Regression?

Commonly denoted as "BLR", it is a conditional data analytical method
for understanding the relationship between independent and dependent
variables based on Bayes Theorem while handling uncertainties with
accuracy and interpretability[@walker2007application].

:::
:::

::: notes
The posterior distribution is proportional to the prior distribution
multiplied by the likelihood function [@baldwin2017introduction].
:::

### MCMC Method

-   The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method involves simulating
    random draws from the posterior distribution, allowing for
    exploration of the parameter space and estimation of the posterior
    distribution even in complex, high-dimensional models
    [@robert2018accelerating; @rojas2020lose].
-   Confirming the convergence of MCMC chains is important for the
    reliability of the results.
-   Evidence of convergence provides confidence in the validity of the
    samples[@marcotte2018gibbs].

### Inferences

-   After obtaining the posterior results, inferences can be used for
    the prior distribution of the current/next experiment
    [@rubio2016bayesian].
    -   Posterior probabilities are assigned to the spectrum of values
        that parameters can assume.
    -   The more prominent the peak, the more effective it is as an
        estimate because a single value has a higher probability
        compared to other values.
        -   The credibility interval, indicating a 95% range of probable
            parameter estimates, is narrower.
        -   Conversely, when the peak is less pronounced, other
            estimates are also plausible, resulting in a wider
            credibility interval for the 95% range of probable parameter
            estimates [@shetty2013evidence; @gill2002bayesian].

### Sensitivity

-   In BLR, even when utilizing representative or informed priors, it is
    crucial to perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of
    different prior specifications on the posterior results.
-   This aims to ensure that the findings are not dependent on the
    choice of prior [@kruschke2021bayesian].

### SSSM

-   Once the experiment is conducted and the posterior distribution is
    obtained, the next step is to conduct a check on skewness of the
    distributions, as well as heteroscedasticity.
-   Although scale mixtures of normal are often used in regression
    analysis to capture heteroscedasticity and outliers, skew-symmetric
    scale mixtures of normal (SSSM) can capture asymmetry, making it
    more robust to use in BLR [@rubio2016bayesian].
:::

## Benefits of BLR

-   More flexible
    -   Captures all uncertain random variables
    -   Good for small sample sizes
    -   Good for various data types
-   Eliminates need for p-values
    -   Richer information on parameters
    -   Allows for simultaneous single change point detection in a
        multivariate sample

::: notes
-   More flexible statistical model as it captures all uncertain random
    variables [@klauenberg2015tutorial] and is also known to be used for
    experiments that have small sample sizes [@sugiarto2021determining]
    and various data types [@kruschke2010bayesian].

-   Eliminates the need for p-values, which offers richer information on
    parameters, and allows for simultaneous single change point
    detection in a multivariate sample [@seidou2007bayesian].

::: notes
-   An example of using BLR includes determining correction coefficients
    to previously inaccurate concrete mixture formulas to ensure the
    correct use and amount of chemicals to prevent and then predict the
    breakdown of the concrete [@zgheib2019bayesian].

-   Another example of BLR is re-determining traffic-flow rate values
    for vehicles to be able to ensure optimal traffic flow and minimize
    to a safe number of vehicles at intersections, which allows for the
    previous rate values from over 20 years ago to be updated
    [@sugiarto2021determining].

-   BLR can also be used to determine the load and strain a bridge can
    take before it is unsafe to be used [@zhang2022long], and it can be
    helpful to predict genetic values for genomic selection for plants
    and animals to prevent the risk of passing on genes that could cause
    illnesses [@perez2010genomic].

# Methods

## Regression Analysis Basics {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Linear Regression Model

Regression analysis is a statistical method that allows to examine the
relationship between two or more variables of interest. Suppose the
response variable $Y$ is a function of several predictor variables,
$x_{i1}, x_{i2},..., x_{ik}$.

To fit a model:

$$
Y = X \beta + \epsilon     \quad(1)
$$ where:

-   $Y = (y_1, y_2,..., y_n)$ is the n×1 vector of response
-   $X$ is a n×p design matrix, $p = k+1$
-   $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1,...., \beta_{k})$is the (k+1)×1 vector of
    parameters
-   $\epsilon = (\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2,...., \epsilon_n)$ the n×1
    vector of errors, $\epsilon$ \~ $N_n(0, \sigma^2I)$

### Likelihood Function

The likelihood function of $y$ given $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ is defined
as follows

$$
f(Y_i = y_i|x, \beta, \sigma^2) = f_y(y|x,\beta,\sigma^2) = (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} exp^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-x\beta)^T(y-x\beta)}  \quad(2)
$$ which describes the probability of observing the data $y$ given the
predictors $x$ and the parameters $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$.

To make an inference, the $\beta$ parameters are determined through
maximizing the likelihood function.
:::

## BLR Basics {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Normal Distribution

BLR is approached through probability distributions. Instead of
estimating the response variable, y, as a single value, it's drawn from
a probability distribution. When using BLR, the model assumes that the
response follows a normal distribution, expressed as

$$
y \sim N(\beta^TX, \sigma^2I)  \quad(3)
$$

where, y is assumed as a normal distribution centered by its mean and
variance.

Additionally, the parameters in the model are generated from a
probability distribution. The posterior probability of these parameters
is proportional to the prior and likelihood [@minka2000bayesian].

$$
P(\beta|y, X) = \frac{P(y|\beta, X) × P(\beta|X)}{P(y|X)}  \quad(4)
$$

::: notes
In linear regression, the mean is calculated by the transpose of the
weight matrix and the predictor matrix. The variance is determined by
squaring the standard deviation $\sigma$ and then multiplying it by the
identity matrix.
:::

### Conjugate Distributions

In Bayesian statistics, when the prior distribution and the posterior
distribution belong to the same family of probability distributions,
they are called conjugate distributions. Using Bayes' theorem, we have
the joint posterior distribution as follows:

$$
f(\beta, \sigma^2|y,x) = \frac{f_y(y|x, \beta,\sigma^2)f(\beta|\sigma^2,m,V)f(\sigma^2|a,b)}{f_y(y)}  \quad(5)
$$

where:

-   $f_y(y|x, \beta,\sigma^2)$ is the likelihood function,

-   $f(\beta|\sigma^2,m,V)$ isthe prior distribution for coefficients,

-   $f(\sigma^2|a,b)$ is the prior distribution for the error variance,
    and

-   $f_y(y)$ is the marginal likelihood.

::: notes
-   The Joint prior distribution of the coefficients $\beta$ and the
    error variance $\sigma^2$ given the data $y$ and the predictors $x$
-   the prior distribution for coefficients $\beta$ given the error
    variance $\sigma^2$, with mean vector $m$ and covariance matrix $V$
-   error variance $\sigma^2$, which is assumed to be an inverse gamma
    distribution with parameter $a$ and $b$
-   marginal likelihood is often treated as a constant
:::

### Non-conjugate distributions

A non-conjugate prior refers to a prior distribution that does not
belong to the same family of distributions as the posterior distribution
after observing data. In such cases, the posterior distribution can be
expressed as

$$
f(\beta|y, X, \sigma^2) ∝ f_y(y|X, \beta)\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(\beta_i|m_i,v_i)  \quad(6)
$$ where:

-   $f(\beta|y, X, \sigma^2)$ is the posterior distribution of
    coefficients,

-   $f_y(y|X, \beta)$ is the likelihood function, and

-   $f(\beta_i|m_i,v_i)$ is the prior distribution of each coefficient.

::: notes
-   is the posterior distribution of coefficients $\beta$ given the
    dependent variable $y$, independent variable $X$ and error variance
    $\sigma^2$.
-   likelihood function, denoting the probability of the observing data
    $y$ given independent variable $X$ and the coefficient parameters
    $\beta$
-   the prior distribution of each coefficient $\beta_i$ with mean $m_i$
    and variance $v_i$

### Analysis of Estimates

We analyzed how the observed data has changed the parameter estimates.

```{r}
# To see how the observed data has changed the parameter estimates

# Conclusion

## Notable Observations {.smaller}

In this project, we successfully explored the effects of the predictors
on Life expectancy and relationships among them. There were some notable
observations while conducting our analysis.

-   There was a significant negative relationship between adult
    mortality, infants deaths, deaths under five years old, and life
    expectancy. As the rates of death of adults, infants, and children
    under 5 years old go up, life expectancy tends to shorten.

-   The rates of thinness of adolescents and adults are also critical
    factors affecting life expectancy, and there is a negative
    relationship existing between them.

-   Life expectancy varies depending on the disparity in years of
    schooling across regions. Generally, life expectancy tends to rise
    with increase of schooling and higher level of economy development
    since 2000.

-   Due to the presence of correlation and multicollinearity, we
    selected only six variables as predictors for conducting Bayesian
    Linear Regression Analysis.

## Bayesian Linear Regression Analysis Conclusion {.smaller}

-   Our model was successful in predicting life expectancy when
    considering the variables of GDP, BMI, Alcohol, schooling and HIV.

-   The convergence of four chains is strong, and it's centered around a
    single value, indicating the excellent performance of the model.

-   Through observing the BLR model, the variables of BMI, Schooling,
    and HIV have more weight on predicting life expectancy.
